info
You can list the changed files as well using the --name-only option with the git log command

Run the command git log --name-only

To view all the branches- both local and remote - run the git branch -a command.

The remote branches have the prefix remotes

git fetch -- to pull all changes from remote repo to local
bu in pull we need fetch + merge
while in pull fetch + merge in one single command


----------------
Now that weâ€™ve fetched the origin master branch, we can update our local master branch with the latest changes made on origin/master branch.
Merge the remote master branch to local master


Syntax: git merge <other-branch>
git merge origin/master
---------
git pull origin master

------------------------merge conflicts--------------
Two users max and Sarah working on the same code with 2 different files with same name. sarah wrote first and pushed to remote.
Now Max has written the code and tries to do git push origin master, he will get error that, remote contains work that you do
not have locally. 
push rejected!
we need to pull fist
git pull origin master
pull means fetch+merge, so when git tries to do merge, it ill get merge conflicts!
to see who did it remotely, git log origin/master

open the file and correct the code
then git add and git merge,
