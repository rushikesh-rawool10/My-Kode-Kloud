info
You can list the changed files as well using the --name-only option with the git log command

Run the command git log --name-only

To view all the branches- both local and remote - run the git branch -a command.

The remote branches have the prefix remotes

git fetch -- to pull all changes from remote repo to local
bu in pull we need fetch + merge
while in pull fetch + merge in one single command


----------------
Now that weâ€™ve fetched the origin master branch, we can update our local master branch with the latest changes made on origin/master branch.
Merge the remote master branch to local master


Syntax: git merge <other-branch>
git merge origin/master
---------
git pull origin master
