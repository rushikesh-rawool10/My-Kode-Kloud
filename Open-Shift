Deployment Strategy
1. rolling update (by default)
    max unavailable: 25% (if 4 then 1 can go down at a time)
    max surge : 25% (if 4 then only 1 max pod create above desired state)
it can be in numbers also instead of a percentage.

2. recreate
all pods killed and newly created
usecase: development(instant kill and redeploy )

3. Blue Green
2 sets of pods blue and green, running simultaneously
in service, we can change, spec:-> replica: service_name


4. Canary Deployment.

few set of users allow to use V2 and continuous testing.

we can create 2 deployments and gradually change replica counts of each
