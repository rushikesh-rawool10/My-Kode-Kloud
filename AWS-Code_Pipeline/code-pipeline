In code build settings, there is Environ ment setting.
  That is AWS managed environment, which provide the platform to build your code.
  Just like in Jenkins we configure worker node, same concept use in aws code build environment settings

code build errors:

solution-->go to environment settings--> override image option-->Privileged-->enable this flag if you want to build docker images or want your builds to get elevated privileges
roles--> ssm access 
create role for code build, it will provide you all required privileges
